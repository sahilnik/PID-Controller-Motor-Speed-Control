Part a)
This testing was performed without the use of a PID controller.
I found through trial and error testing that when the motor PWM
is running at 70% PWM Duty Cycle (178/255), the output speed was
steady around 500 RPM. Due to the lack of any feedback loop,
variation of + 5 RPM was present.
Therefore although rated at 500 RPM at 12V, with PWM control
we can achieve 500 RPM at a duty cycle of 70%.
At 100% PWM duty cycle the output motor speed is 560 RPM.

Part b)
Since there is no feedback loop, the motor requires a greater
duty cycle to overcome the initial static friction that is
holding it in place. Without an integral gain feedback, the
output to the motor has to be large enough to begin spinning
without increasing.
Therefore I performed 2 experiments regarding minimum motor
speed.

Experiment 1.	If the duty cycle is set to 1% (2/255) the motor
		cannot begin rotating without external help.
		I gave the motor a push to begin its rotation
		while the PWM duty cycle is steady at 1%. The
		motor speed at 1% duty cycle, once the motor is
		moving is around 115 RPM.

Experiment 2.	Without an external push, the minimum duty cycle
		required to move the motor was found to be 
		15% (38/255). At this duty cycle the motor 
		reaches a steady state speed of 183 RPM.
